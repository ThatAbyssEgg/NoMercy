Console game that uses cloud saving technology!

Requirements: Any client-server interactions

Accomplished by creating a server that contains and edits game data.

This project helped me to accomplish those goals:
- Create a project that uses TCP connection to transfer valuable data
- Create a tiny RPG-like game

Those project goals were planned, but NOT accomplished:

- Create graphics, instead of using a console application
- Realize the PvP system between two players on different devices
